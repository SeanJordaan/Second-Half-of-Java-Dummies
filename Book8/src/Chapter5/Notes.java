Working with XML
    
In this chapter, you find out how to work with Extensible Markup Language
This chapter focuses on the basics of reading an XML document into memory and 
extracting data from it
    
    
Defining XML
    
Most computer-industry pundits agree that XML will completely change the way 
you work with computers    
1)Unlock the vast warehouses of data that are locked up in the vaults of 
  corporate mainframe computers
2)Enable every electronic device on the planet, from the most complex 
  supercomputers to desktop computers to cellphones to wristwatches, to 
  communicate with one another   
3)Allow every computer program ever written to exchange data with every 
  other computer program ever written
4)Probably cure cancer and solve the budget deficit, too   
Simply put, XML is a way to store and exchange information in a standardized way that’s easy to
create, retrieve, and transfer between different types of computer systems or programs.    
When XML is stored in a file, the file is usually given the extension .xml.
    
    
   
Tags
    
Like Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), XML uses tags to mark the data.    
Notice that each element begins with a tag that lists the element’s name. This tag 
is called the start tag. The element ends with an element that repeats the element 
name, preceded by a slash — an end tag
    <Book> Like this </Book>     
Everything in between the tags is called the content 
If elements are  nested within the tags they are called child elements and the tag is reverd to as the parent element
The highest-level element in an XML document is called the root element.  
Although XML superficially resembles HTML, you find two key differences    
1)The tags used in HTML indicate the format of data that displays, whereas tags 
in an XML document indicate the meaning of the data. 
2) The tags used in an HTML document are set in stone, whereas you can make 
up any tags you want to use in an XML document. If you’re creating an XML 
document about cars, you may use tags such as <Make>, <Model>, and <Year>. 
    
    
Attributes
    
Instead of using child elements, you can use attributes to provide data for an 
element. An attribute is a name-and-value pair that’s written inside the start tag 
for an element.    
But its a matter of personal prefrance     
    
The XML declaration
    
Every XML file should begin with an XML declaration that identifies the version of 
XML being used. For most XML documents, the declaration should look like this:
    <?xml version='1.0'?>    
Declarations dont need a end tag
Go to isting Movies.xml
